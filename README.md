# Advent of Code 2024 - Solutions in Python

Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code 2024**! ðŸŽ„âœ¨ Here, you'll find solutions to all 25 days of coding challenges, implemented in Python. Each day's folder contains the solution script and the input data needed to run the code.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
AdventOfCode2024/
|
â”œâ”€â”€ day01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day1.py          # Python solution for Day 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt        # Input file for Day 1
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ day02/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day2.py          # Python solution for Day 2
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt        # Input file for Day 2
â”‚
... and so on for all 25 days.
```

Each folder corresponds to a specific dayâ€™s challenge and contains:

- **Solution Script (`dayX.py`)**: The Python script implementing the solution.
- **Input File (`input.txt`)**: The input data for the challenge, as provided by Advent of Code.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

To run the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/AdventOfCode2024.git
   cd AdventOfCode2024
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the specific day you want to run:
   ```bash
   cd day01
   ```

3. Execute the Python script with:
   ```bash
   python day1.py
   ```
   Ensure that the `input.txt` file is in the same folder as the script. The script reads the input file and outputs the solution to the console.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Modules Used**: No external libraries are required. All solutions are implemented using Pythonâ€™s built-in modules.

## ðŸ“œ Challenges Overview

Advent of Code is a series of daily programming puzzles released every December. Each challenge requires critical thinking, problem-solving, and coding skills. Here is a brief overview of what each dayâ€™s solution accomplishes:

| Day  | Challenge Title          | Description                                  |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Example Challenge Day 1 | Process input data and calculate results.   |
| 2    | Example Challenge Day 2 | Advanced operations on structured input.    |
| ...  |                          |                                              |
| 25   | Final Challenge          | Complex task wrapping up all prior lessons. |
